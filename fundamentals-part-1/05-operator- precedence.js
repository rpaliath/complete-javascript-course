// mathematical operator precedence:
//Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).

//multiplication before addition:
 let   x  = 10 + 5 * 2;
// Evaluates as 10 + (5 * 2) = 20


// forcing order with parentheses or grouping:
x =  (10+5) *2
// Evaluates as (15) *2 = 30
