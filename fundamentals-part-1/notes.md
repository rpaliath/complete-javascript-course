reserved key words:cannot be used in naming  variables
1. the word: new

conventons which are not illegal but are not generally used by developers:
1. the word 'name' is generally not used but can be done as say firstName, lastName etc
2. never start a variable name with a capital letter like say : Person instead always use person.
3. some constants are shown in capital letters in javascript for eg: the word PI which is equal to 3.1415.
